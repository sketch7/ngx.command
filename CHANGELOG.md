## [2.1.0](https://github.com/sketch7/ngx.command/compare/2.0.0...2.1.0) (2022-07-12)

### Features

- **util:** `canExecuteFromNgForm` now have delay(0) which is fixing issue when observable `form.statusChanges` wasn't triggered after reset or make pristine form from the code.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/sketch7/ngx.command/compare/1.6.0...2.0.0) (2021-08-25)

### Features

- **deps:** update dependencies to support Angular v10

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **command:** remove deprecated code
- **command:** change `ssvCommand` and `ssvCommandRef` when using `CommandCreator` e.g. this syntax only `[ssvCommandRef]="{host: this, execute: removeHero$}` to require `host: this`. 
    This was added due to a limitation (which previously was handled via hack and is not supported anymore). [See this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8277).
- **module:** rename module to `SsvCommandModule` from `CommandModule`

- **command directive:** now takes a command creator which is now able to create command `[command]="{execute: removeHero$, canExecute: isValid$, params: [hero, 1337, 'xx']}"`

  This is useful for collections (loops) or using multiple actions with different args, whilst not sharing `isExecuting`.

- **util:** export `isCommand` and `isCommandCreator` utils, which check type of object.
